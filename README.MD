# Christmas Holiday Exercise :christmas_tree:

Unfortunately, we do not have our Java meeting for a long time :cry:. That is why we will use the time to repeat and deepen.
Your homework consists of four parts. One part will be some practical coding exercises the other ones are more theoretical.

Every task is in one folder named `task1...4`. In every folder, there is a Markdown file with your instructions. Mostly there is only one Markdown, these are the non-coding exercises. 

## Workload
* The homework may seem much, but you have a lot of time and it is intended to be worked out in several days over your holidays.
* If you are not able to do everything for any reason please prioritize task2, the OOP recap. This is the most important one.

## Meeting
As you already know you can drop me a message anytime on Discord. Nevertheless, I want to offer you Q/A meetings for the homework on the voice channel.

* 22.12 15:30 - 16:00
* 23.12 18:00 - 19:00
* 28.12 18:00 - 19:00

We can also make up a date in January if needed. The meetings are more or less open end, except for the first one, since I have a course at 16:00.

**Important:** The goal is to fully understand inheritance (Vererbung) after Christmas break.

I appreciate your hard work whether learning with the book or by doing the advent of code challenges. You can be really proud of yourself. Hard work will pay off.

**NOTE:** Maybe it is a good idea to start with `task2` before implementing `task1`.
